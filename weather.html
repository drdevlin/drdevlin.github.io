    <h3>Impulse</h3>
    <p>
      While building a weather app using Environment Canada's RSS feed, I needed a way to extract weather data from the XML.
      A JSON API was not available, and I found the XML API unwieldy.
      So, I developed a human-centric, JavaScript-friendly API: a simple JavaScript object with intuitive, straight-forward properties
      for accessing the weather data.

    <h3>Notable Features</h3>
    <p>▸ Get current conditions</p>
    <p>▸ Get forecast for a specific date</p>
    <p>▸ Get weekly forecast</p>
    <p>▸ Get hourly forecast</p>
    <p>▸ Narrow weekly and hourly forecasts to just temperatures or precipitation or winds</p>
    <p>▸ JSDoc documentation</p>
    <p>▸ Jest tested</p>

    <h3>Highlight</h3>
    <p>
      One intuitive feature I wanted was the ability to narrow weekly and hourly forecasts to just temperatures or precipitation or winds.
      And I wanted to do this by chaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>weather.weekly</code> yields an array of detailed objects for every day of the week,
      but <code>weather.weekly.temperatures</code> should yield an array of simplified objects with just the day of the week and the temperature for that day.
      Similarly, for <code>weather.weekly.precipitation</code> and <code>weather.weekly.winds</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To accomplish this, I extended the Array class with getters that could yield the appropriately narrowed arrays.
      This way, <code>weather.weekly</code> yields a detailed array that can be handled like a regular array.
      But this array also possesses getters that can yield further arrays.
